  # Description: 
  This allows a user to drive and control their Roomba from anywhere in the world! Using React, SocketIO, Create2, and  ApolloQL
  # <span id="installation"></span>
  # PreRequisites and Install Info:
  This app requires quite a few prerequisites, including a Roomba, a 7Pin Serial Port Cable, a Raspberry Pi with a battery, and a webcam. After running npm install from the root folder, ssh into your rasPi and drag the RobotApp folder to your rasPi. You will need ffmpeg-streamer and the proper drivers for your webcam and serialport cables. Follow the documentation for ffmpeg and driver installation/initialization to get your webcam running, since almost all webcam/linux drivers are different, and a little tricky.
